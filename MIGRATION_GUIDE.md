# Migration Guide

This guide summarises the steps required when upgrading between major versions of the design system.

1. Review the release notes for breaking changes.
2. Update `@k2600x/design-system` to the latest major version.
3. Ensure your project meets the peer dependency requirements listed in [REQUIREMENTS.md](./REQUIREMENTS.md).
4. Rebuild your application and verify component styling and behaviour.

Future releases will include more detailed instructions when breaking changes are introduced.
