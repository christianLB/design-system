# Requirements

This design system is distributed as a library of React components. The package expects the following peer dependencies to be present in your project:

- **react** >= 17.0.0
- **react-dom** >= 17.0.0

The components themselves make use of several supporting libraries which will be installed automatically when you install this package:

- @radix-ui/react-checkbox
- @radix-ui/react-dialog
- @radix-ui/react-popover
- @radix-ui/react-select
- @radix-ui/react-slot
- @radix-ui/react-switch
- @radix-ui/react-tabs
- @tanstack/react-table
- @types/react-select
- class-variance-authority
- clsx
- lucide-react
- react-select
- tailwind-merge
- tailwindcss-animate
- zustand

Ensure your project uses a version of React compatible with these dependencies (React 17 or newer).  The library's styles also rely on Tailwind CSS v4.
