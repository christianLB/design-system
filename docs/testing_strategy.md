# Testing Strategy for the Design System

This document outlines the testing strategy for the design system, ensuring high quality, reliability, and maintainability. It defines the types of tests, recommended tools, testing environments, and execution steps.

## Types of Tests

### 1. Unit Tests

**Description:** Unit tests verify individual components in isolation. They ensure that each component works as expected on a granular level.

**Why:**
*   **Early Bug Detection:** Catch bugs early in the development process.
*   **Code Refactoring:** Allow for code changes with confidence.
*   **Documentation:** Serve as living documentation of how components should behave.

**Suggested Tools:**
*   **Jest:** A JavaScript testing framework that's easy to set up and use.
*   **React Testing Library:** A testing utility that encourages testing components from a user's perspective.

### 2. Component Integration Tests

**Description:** Integration tests verify that components work together as expected. They check the interaction between different parts of the design system.

**Why:**
*   **Component Interactions:** Verify that components interact correctly.
*   **Data Flow:** Ensure data is passed correctly between components.
*   **Real-World Scenarios:** Test components in more realistic combinations.

**Suggested Tools:**
*   **Jest:** Can be used to test component integration.
*   **React Testing Library:** Useful for integration testing in React projects.

### 3. Visual Regression Tests

**Description:** Visual regression tests compare the rendered output of components against a baseline snapshot. They detect unintended visual changes.

**Why:**
*   **UI Consistency:** Ensure that visual changes are intentional.
*   **Prevent Regressions:** Catch accidental visual alterations.
*   **UI Refactoring:** Help during visual refactoring.

**Suggested Tools:**
*   **Chromatic:** A tool that makes it easy to capture and manage visual snapshots.
*   **Storybook:** Provides a visual development environment and can be integrated with visual testing tools.
*   **Playwright:** A great end-to-end testing framework that also supports visual regression testing.

### 4. Accessibility Tests

**Description:** Accessibility tests check if the components adhere to accessibility standards (WCAG).

**Why:**
*   **Inclusivity:** Ensure the design system is usable by people with disabilities.
*   **Compliance:** Meet accessibility requirements.
*   **Usability:** Improve the overall usability of the components.

**Suggested Tools:**
*   **axe:** An accessibility testing engine.
*   **react-axe:** Integrates axe with React.
*   **Storybook:** Provides addons for accessibility testing.

### 5. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

**Description:** E2E tests simulate real user workflows to check if the components function correctly in a complete application.

**Why:**
*   **User Flow Validation:** Test entire user flows through the design system.
*   **Integration with External Systems:** Verify integration with external libraries or APIs.
*   **Real-World Scenarios:** Ensure the design system works in a fully integrated environment.

**Suggested Tools:**
*   **Playwright:** A testing framework to create cross-browser E2E tests.
*   **Cypress:** Similar to Playwright, with a focus on testing web applications.

## Testing Environments

### 1. Development Environment

**Description:** Local environment used by developers.
**Purpose:** Run unit and integration tests during development. Visual regression tests can be run locally before committing changes.
**Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library, local Storybook.

### 2. Continuous Integration (CI) Environment

**Description:** Automated environment that runs tests on each code commit or pull request.
**Purpose:** Catch issues early, prevent broken code from merging, and ensure code quality.
**Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library, Chromatic, axe, Playwright, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI.

### 3. Staging Environment

**Description:** A replica of the production environment used to test new features before release.
**Purpose:** Run E2E tests and ensure that the components work correctly in a real-world setup.
**Tools:** Playwright, Cypress.

## Steps to Execute Tests

### 1. Unit and Integration Tests

1.  **Write Tests:** Create test files (`.test.js`, `.test.jsx`, `.test.ts`, `.test.tsx`) that describe the expected behavior of each component.
2.  **Run Tests:** Execute the tests using the test runner (e.g., `npm test`).
3.  **Check Results:** Review the test output to identify and fix failures.

### 2. Visual Regression Tests

1.  **Create Snapshots:** Generate visual snapshots of the components in a known good state.
2.  **Make Changes:** Modify the components.
3.  **Run Tests:** Run the visual regression test tool.
4.  **Review Differences:** Examine the differences between the new version and the previous snapshot. Approve changes if they are intentional or fix them if they are bugs.

### 3. Accessibility Tests

1.  **Integrate Axe:** Add axe to the testing suite.
2.  **Run Tests:** Execute the accessibility tests.
3.  **Fix Issues:** Address any accessibility violations that the tests report.

### 4. End-to-End Tests

1.  **Write E2E Tests:** Create tests that simulate user interactions with the application.
2.  **Run Tests:** Execute the E2E test suite using Playwright or Cypress.
3.  **Check Results:** Review the results and fix any failures.

## Conclusion

This testing strategy provides a comprehensive plan to test and maintain the quality of the design system. By implementing these tests, we will ensure that the design system remains reliable, consistent, and accessible.
