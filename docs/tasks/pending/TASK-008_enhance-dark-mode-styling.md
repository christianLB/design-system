# TASK-008: Enhance Dark Mode Styling

**ID:** TASK-008
**Status:** pending
**Assigned to:** Cascade
**Reported by:** USER
**Date Created:** 2025-05-22

## 1. Description
This task aims to improve the visual appeal, usability, and accessibility of the dark mode theme across the design system. Current dark mode styling suffers from issues like poor contrast, dark text on dark backgrounds, and indistinct UI elements such as borders.

## 2. Current Issues/Context
-   Text often has insufficient contrast against dark backgrounds, making it difficult to read.
-   Many font colors remain dark, similar to their light mode counterparts, leading to poor visibility in dark mode.
-   Borders, dividers, and other subtle UI elements lack clear definition in dark mode.
-   The overall dark mode experience feels unpolished and may not meet accessibility standards for contrast.

## 3. Implementation Plan

### 3.1. Analysis and Strategy
1.  **Comprehensive Review:** Systematically review all components (Buttons, Cards, Inputs, Modals, Tables, etc.) in dark mode to identify and document specific instances of poor contrast and visibility.
2.  **Accessibility Audit:** Utilize accessibility checking tools (e.g., browser developer tools, Axe, WAVE) to measure contrast ratios for text, interactive elements, and graphical objects. Aim for WCAG AA compliance at a minimum, striving for AAA where feasible.
3.  **Color Palette Refinement:**
    *   Define or refine a dedicated dark mode color palette. This includes primary/secondary backgrounds, surface colors, text colors (primary, secondary, disabled), border colors, and accent colors.
    *   Ensure the new palette provides sufficient contrast steps.
    *   Consider the semantic meaning of colors and their application in dark mode (e.g., `primary`, `secondary`, `destructive`, `warning`).
4.  **Theme Configuration Update:**
    *   Review and update the Tailwind CSS configuration (`tailwind.config.js`), particularly the `theme.extend.colors` and `darkMode` sections.
    *   Update CSS custom variables for theming (likely in `src/styles/themes.ts` or a similar global stylesheet) to reflect the new dark mode palette.

### 3.2. Styling Adjustments
1.  **Global Styles:** Apply foundational dark mode styles globally (e.g., body background, default text color).
2.  **Component-Specific Styling:**
    *   Iterate through each component, adjusting its styles for dark mode using Tailwind's `dark:` variant.
    *   Focus on:
        *   Text colors ensuring readability.
        *   Background colors of containers, inputs, buttons.
        *   Border colors for definition and separation.
        *   States: hover, focus, active, disabled states for all interactive elements.
3.  **Utility Classes:** Ensure utility classes for colors and borders work as expected in dark mode.

### 3.3. Downstream Impact and Verification
1.  **Demo Application:** Update the demo application (`demo/`) to thoroughly showcase all components in the improved dark mode.
2.  **Documentation:** Update any screenshots or style guides in the documentation (`docs/`) to reflect the new dark mode aesthetics.
3.  **Cross-Browser Testing:** Verify consistent appearance and behavior across major browsers.

## 4. Testing Instructions
1.  Ensure the application/demo is running.
2.  Switch to Dark Mode.
3.  Navigate through all pages and components in the demo application.
4.  **Visual Inspection:**
    *   Verify that all text is easily readable with good contrast.
    *   Check that borders, dividers, and UI element outlines are clearly visible.
    *   Confirm that interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links) have distinct and accessible styling in all states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled).
5.  **Accessibility Tools:** Use browser developer tools or accessibility extensions to check contrast ratios for key elements.
6.  **Light Mode Check:** Switch back to Light Mode and verify that no unintended changes have affected the light theme. All light mode styles should remain as they were.
7.  Test on different screen sizes and resolutions.
