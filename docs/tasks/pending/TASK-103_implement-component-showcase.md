# TASK-103: Implement Component Showcase for Design System v2.0.0

## Overview
Now that we've standardized the components and released version 2.0.0 of the design system, we need to create a comprehensive showcase that demonstrates all components with their variants, props, and usage examples. This will serve as both documentation and a testing environment for the design system.

### Workspace & Repository Information
- **Workspace Location**: `c:\dev\design-system-showcase`
- **Repository URL**: https://github.com/christianLB/design-system-showcase.git
- **Current Status**: Repository needs to be initialized with the existing content

## Objectives
- Initialize the design-system-showcase repository with the existing content
- Create a main branch and then branch off for v2 implementation
- Install and configure Storybook or a similar tool (alternatives to evaluate: Ladle, Docusaurus, or a custom solution)
- Set up a comprehensive showcase for all standardized components
- Demonstrate theme switching capabilities
- Document component props, variants, and usage examples
- Implement visual testing capabilities

## Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- Initialize Git repository at `c:\dev\design-system-showcase`
- Create initial commit with current content
- Push to the repository at https://github.com/christianLB/design-system-showcase.git
- Create a new branch `feature/v2-component-showcase` from main
- Install the required documentation tool as a development dependency
- Update to design-system v2.0.0
- Configure the tool to work with the design system's theming system
- Implement stories/examples for all components
- Ensure responsive design views are available
- Set up deployment pipeline for the showcase

### Documentation Requirements
- Each component should have:
  - Basic usage example
  - Props documentation with types and default values
  - All variant examples
  - Theming examples (dark/light mode)
  - Accessibility notes
  - Code snippets for implementation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Repository & Branch Setup
1. Initialize Git repository in the `c:\dev\design-system-showcase` directory
2. Create initial commit with existing content
3. Create remote repository on GitHub
4. Push main branch to remote
5. Create and checkout a new `feature/v2-component-showcase` branch

### Phase 2: Setup & Configuration
1. Update dependencies to use design-system v2.0.0
2. Research and select the best documentation tool
3. Install and configure the selected tool
4. Set up basic project structure

### Phase 3: Component Documentation
1. Create documentation templates for components
2. Implement documentation for each component category:
   - Typography components
   - Form components
   - Layout components
   - Navigation components
   - Feedback components
   - Data display components

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Implement theme switching in the documentation
2. Add interactive examples where applicable
3. Set up visual regression testing
4. Create a comprehensive homepage and navigation

### Phase 5: Deployment & Finalization
1. Configure CI/CD for automatic deployment
2. Conduct final review and testing
3. Merge to main and deploy
4. Communicate the availability of the new documentation to stakeholders

## Success Criteria
- All components from design-system v2.0.0 are documented
- Documentation is visually appealing and user-friendly
- Examples work correctly in all supported browsers
- Theme switching demonstrates component adaptability
- Documentation site is deployed and accessible

## Resources
- [Storybook Documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction)

## Timeline
- Research and Setup: 2 days
- Basic Implementation: 3 days
- Complete Documentation: 5 days
- Testing and Refinement: 2 days
- Total: Approximately 2 weeks
