# Extend Demo Page with All Components

## Description
The current demo page showcases only Button, Card, and Table components. We need to extend it to include all existing components from the components directory, providing a comprehensive showcase and documentation platform.

## Important Note
This task should ONLY use existing components from the components directory. No new components should be created for this demo page. The list of components should be based on what currently exists in the codebase.

## Summary

All the interactive components have been successfully implemented and integrated into the demo page. Each component includes comprehensive examples showcasing its features, variants, and usage patterns. The demo page provides a solid foundation for users to understand how to use these components in their applications.

### Key Features Implemented:

1. **Comprehensive Examples**: Each component has multiple examples demonstrating different use cases and configurations.
2. **Interactive Demos**: Users can interact with the components directly in the browser.
3. **Form Integration**: Examples show how to use components within forms with proper validation.
4. **Accessibility**: Components are built with accessibility in mind, following WAI-ARIA patterns.
5. **Responsive Design**: Components work well on different screen sizes.
6. **Theming**: Support for light and dark modes.

### Next Steps:

1. **Documentation**: Add detailed documentation for each component, including props, usage guidelines, and best practices.
2. **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for all components.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Identify and address any performance bottlenecks.
4. **Additional Components**: Consider adding more components based on user feedback and requirements.
5. **Theming System**: Enhance the theming system to allow for more customization options.

### Notes:

- The demo page serves as both a showcase and a development environment for testing components.
- All components are built using Radix UI primitives for accessibility and functionality.
- Styling is done using Tailwind CSS with a custom theme configuration.
