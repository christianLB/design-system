# TASK-104: Storybook Design System Integration

## Description
Create a proper integration between the @k2600x/design-system package and Storybook in the design-system-showcase project. The current implementation shows loading spinners instead of properly rendered components, indicating compatibility issues between the design system package and Storybook configuration.

## Current Issues/Context
1. The design-system-showcase project attempts to display components from @k2600x/design-system v2.0.0 in Storybook v8.6.x
2. Initial attempts to implement component stories result in perpetual loading spinners with no errors
3. Component stories fail to render despite successful Storybook startup
4. Potential issues include:
   - Incompatible component export/import mechanisms
   - CSS/styling configuration conflicts
   - Missing peer dependencies
   - Improper theme initialization
   - Potential ES modules vs CommonJS conflicts

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Analysis Phase
- [ ] Analyze the @k2600x/design-system package structure
  - [ ] Examine the package.json entry points (main, module, types fields)
  - [ ] Review the export patterns used in index.ts/index.js
  - [ ] Verify CSS/styling file paths and import mechanisms
  - [ ] Check if the design system uses any browser-only APIs that might not be available in Storybook

- [ ] Analyze Storybook compatibility requirements
  - [ ] Review Storybook v8.x documentation for React component libraries
  - [ ] Identify required configuration for CSS-in-JS or CSS modules
  - [ ] Check dependencies and peer dependencies requirements
  - [ ] Review how Storybook handles theming and CSS variables

### 2. Configuration Phase
- [ ] Create minimal test cases
  - [ ] Create a simplified test component directly in the showcase
  - [ ] Create a simplified story that imports a single component from design system
  - [ ] Implement proper debugging to capture and log any errors

- [ ] Configure proper bundling and module resolution
  - [ ] Set up appropriate Vite/Webpack configuration for Storybook
  - [ ] Configure module resolution for design system imports
  - [ ] Set up CSS/styling pipeline correctly

- [ ] Implement theme integration
  - [ ] Configure theme provider in preview.js
  - [ ] Set up CSS variables correctly
  - [ ] Configure light/dark mode toggle

### 3. Implementation Phase
- [ ] Implement fixed component stories based on analysis
  - [ ] Create working examples of basic components (Button, Card, etc.)
  - [ ] Document the correct import and usage patterns
  - [ ] Create helper utilities/decorators if needed

- [ ] Document solutions and best practices
  - [ ] Create guidelines for importing and using design system components
  - [ ] Document any workarounds needed for specific components
  - [ ] Update project README with setup instructions

## Testing Instructions
1. Run `npm run storybook` in the design-system-showcase project
2. Verify that components render properly without spinners
3. Test dark/light mode theme switching
4. Verify that all component variants and states render correctly
5. Test component interactions like clicks and form inputs

## Dependencies
- **Technical Dependencies**:
  - @k2600x/design-system@2.0.0
  - Storybook v8.6.x
  - React/React DOM
  - Tailwind CSS
  - PostCSS

- **Prerequisite Tasks**:
  - TASK-103 (Component Showcase Implementation) - Need to understand current approach
  - Design System v2.0.0 component standardization (to understand component structure)

## Notes
This task requires careful analysis rather than trial-and-error approaches. The goal is to establish a reliable, maintainable pattern for showcasing design system components that can be used for all components in the library.

Upon completion, we should have a working Storybook setup that:
1. Correctly displays all design system components with proper styling
2. Supports theme switching between light and dark modes
3. Showcases component variants and states
4. Provides proper documentation for each component
