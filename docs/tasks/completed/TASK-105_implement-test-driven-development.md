# TASK-105: Implement Test-Driven Development (TDD) [COMPLETED]

## Description
This task outlines the plan to implement Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices within the `@k2600x/design-system` project. The primary goals are to improve component structure, ensure clear feature definition, enhance code quality, and significantly reduce regressions by creating a robust test suite.

## Rationale
Adopting TDD will lead to:
- **More Robust Components:** Writing tests before code forces a clear definition of component APIs and behaviors.
- **Reduced Regressions:** A comprehensive test suite acts as a safety net, catching unintended side effects of changes early.
- **Improved Code Quality:** The Red-Green-Refactor cycle encourages cleaner, more maintainable code.
- **Living Documentation:** Tests serve as executable specifications for how components should behave.
- **Increased Developer Confidence:** Enables safer refactoring and feature additions.

## Proposed Testing Toolkit
For the `c:\dev\design-system` project (Vite, React, TypeScript):
- **Test Runner & Framework:** Vitest (with `@vitest/ui` for a better DX)
- **Component Testing Library:** React Testing Library (`@testing-library/react`)
- **DOM Assertions:** `@testing-library/jest-dom`
- **Test Environment:** `jsdom`
- **Accessibility Testing:** `axe-core` with `jest-axe`
- **(Recommended for future consideration) Visual Regression Testing:** Tools like Chromatic, Percy, or Lost Pixel.

## Core TDD Cycle: Red-Green-Refactor
1.  **RED:** Write a test that defines a small piece of functionality. Ensure it fails.
2.  **GREEN:** Write the minimum code required to make the test pass.
3.  **REFACTOR:** Improve the implementation and test code, ensuring all tests still pass.

## Scope of Tests
- **Unit Tests:** Focus on individual components, hooks, and utility functions in isolation. Test props, state changes, event handling, and rendering logic.
- **Integration Tests:** Test how multiple components interact or how components work with context/providers.
- **Accessibility (a11y) Tests:** Integrate `axe-core` checks into component tests to ensure WCAG compliance.

## Test Location and Structure
- **Primary Location:** Tests will reside within the `c:\dev\design-system` project.
- **Component Tests:** `src/components/ComponentName/__tests__/ComponentName.test.tsx` (or `.spec.tsx`).
- **Conventions:**
    - Use clear, behavior-driven test descriptions (e.g., `it('should call onClick when the primary button is clicked')`).
    - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern for test structure.

## Applying TDD
- **New Development:** All new components and features should be developed using the TDD cycle.
- **Bug Fixes:** When a bug is identified, first write a failing test that reproduces the bug. Then, fix the bug and ensure the test passes.
- **Existing Code:** Gradually increase test coverage for existing components. Prioritize critical or frequently changed components. Apply the "Boy Scout Rule": always leave the code cleaner (and better tested) than you found it.

## Workflow Integration
- **Local Development:** Utilize Vitest's watch mode (`pnpm test --watch`) for immediate feedback.
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Implement pre-commit hooks (e.g., using Husky and lint-staged) to run relevant tests and linters before committing code.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Configure the CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run the full test suite on every push and pull request. Passing tests should be a prerequisite for merging.

## Implementation First Steps
1.  **Tooling Setup:**
    - Install necessary dev dependencies: `pnpm add -D vitest @vitest/ui jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom axe-core jest-axe`
    - Configure `vitest.config.ts` (or extend `vite.config.ts`) for the test environment, globals, and setup files (e.g., for `jest-dom` matchers).
2.  **Pilot Component:** Select a simple new component (or a small, stable existing one) to implement/test using TDD to familiarize the team with the process.
3.  **Documentation:** Ensure this task and TDD principles are documented within the project's development guidelines.
4.  **Gradual Adoption:** Roll out TDD practices incrementally, starting with new features and critical bug fixes.

## Benefits Summary
- Clearer component APIs and feature definitions.
- Executable documentation.
- Significant reduction in regressions.
- Higher confidence in code changes and refactoring.
- Overall improvement in design system stability and maintainability.

## Related Files
- `vitest.config.ts` (to be created/updated)
- `vite.config.ts`
- `package.json` (for script updates and dependencies)
- `src/components/ComponentName/__tests__/ComponentName.test.tsx` (pattern for new test files)

## Dependencies
- None (this task establishes a new process)

## Completion Status

**Completed on:** May 24, 2025

### Implemented Features

1. **Testing Framework Setup**
   - Successfully configured Vitest with React Testing Library and jest-dom
   - Created `setupTests.ts` for test environment configuration
   - Added test scripts to package.json

2. **Component-Level Tests**
   - Implemented Button component tests
   - Implemented Card component tests following the folder structure convention
   - Created a template for component testing that can be reused

3. **Package-Level Integration Tests**
   - Created tests for verifying package exports
   - Implemented build output validation tests
   - Added consumer compatibility tests
   - Set up styling verification tests

4. **TDD Workflow Implementation**
   - Configured pre-commit hooks using Husky and lint-staged
   - Set up CI integration with GitHub Actions
   - Created comprehensive testing documentation

5. **Documentation**
   - Added a detailed testing guide in `docs/guides/testing.md`
   - Documented TDD principles and testing practices

### Next Steps

- Continue implementing tests for all remaining components
- Gradually increase test coverage across the design system
- Consider adding visual regression testing in the future
