# [COMPLETED] TASK-005: Review Component Exports

**Completed on:** 2025-05-22

## Summary
Successfully standardized exports for the following components to use named exports:
- Accordion
- Alert
- Avatar
- Breadcrumb (and BreadcrumbItem)
- Carousel
- FileUpload
- DatePicker

## Implementation Details
- Converted all components from default exports to named exports
- Ensured all component props interfaces are properly exported
- Updated index.ts to properly re-export all components and their types
- Fixed DatePicker exports that were missed in the initial pass
- Published updates as v1.4.10

## Verification
- All components can now be imported using named imports:
  ```typescript
  import { ComponentName } from '@k2600x/design-system';
  ```
- TypeScript types are properly inferred
- Build process completes without warnings

## Original Task

## Description
Review and fix the export issues for the following components that are showing "no exported member" errors in their respective demo files:

- Accordion (lint ID: 476b50a1-7398-4e30-a211-61c1b7c8c461 in AccordionDemo.tsx)
- Alert (based on previous linter feedback, e.g., f4a8162e-7235-4fe5-980d-4941f623415e in AlertDemo.tsx)
- Avatar (based on previous linter feedback, e.g., 08712dff-e6b4-442d-b934-99e2bc7b3288 in AvatarDemo.tsx)
- Breadcrumb (and BreadcrumbItem) (lint ID: 8dce7c67-127b-4b86-8b93-24e296de431c in BreadcrumbDemo.tsx)
- Carousel (lint ID: ff788161-fbaf-46e7-b7c8-217bad894382 in CarouselDemo.tsx)
- FileUpload (based on previous linter feedback, e.g., 85991de0-0d17-4809-84d8-8ca43a54c556 in FileUploadDemo.tsx)

## Current Issues
- The demo files for these components are showing TypeScript errors about missing exports
- The components may not be properly exported from their index.ts files
- The exports may not match the import statements in the demo files

## Implementation Plan
1. For each component:
   - Check the component's directory structure
   - Verify the component is properly exported from its index.ts file
   - Check the import statements in the demo files
   - Update the exports/imports as needed to resolve the TypeScript errors

2. Testing:
   - Run the demo application to verify the components work as expected
   - Ensure there are no TypeScript errors in the demo files
   - Verify the components render correctly in the browser

- `demo/pages/` (various demo files)

## Dependencies
- None

## Notes
- Do not make changes to paths, build configuration, or vite.config
- Follow the project's existing export patterns and conventions
- Ensure all components are properly typed
