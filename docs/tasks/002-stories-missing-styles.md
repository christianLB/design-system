# Stories Not Showing Theme Styles

## Description
Stories are currently being displayed with default HTML styles instead of the application's theme styles. This makes it difficult to properly visualize and test components in Storybook as they don't reflect the actual styling that will be applied in the application.

## Current Behavior
- Stories render with default browser styles
- Theme variables, colors, and typography are not being applied
- Components don't match their intended appearance in the actual application

## Expected Behavior
- Stories should load and apply all theme styles
- Components should be displayed with the correct theming (colors, typography, spacing, etc.)
- Storybook preview should match the component's appearance in the application

## Possible Causes
1. Theme provider might be missing from Storybook's preview
2. CSS/SCSS files containing theme variables might not be properly imported
3. Storybook might not be configured to process the styling pipeline correctly
4. Theme context might not be properly set up in Storybook's preview

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All stories load with the correct theme styles applied
- [ ] Theme variables (colors, typography, spacing) are properly loaded
- [ ] Components in Storybook match their appearance in the application
- [ ] Theme switching (if applicable) works correctly in Storybook
